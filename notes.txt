Take age in years and convert to seconds
Take two dates and determine the difference between the two (in seconds)
Return age of a person in Mercury years (.24 Earth years)
Return age of a person in Venus years (.62 Earth years)
Return age of a person in Mars years (1.88 Earth years)

Return date of user's next birthday on each planet
Return age of Keith Richards in dog years on Jupiter in 2073
Average lifespan of a mayfly is 5 minutes - how any mayfly lifespans will a human user have lived, and compare it to current age of our sun (in Earth years)
Give the application a solar theme!
